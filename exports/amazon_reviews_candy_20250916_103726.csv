SOUR PATCH KIDS and SWEDISH FISH Mini Soft & Chewy...,Jacob,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2025",Man I love me some sour patch kids and I'll be brutually honest and say I've never tried swedish fish until now. Boy it's an amazing combination and I can't believe I waited this long to try swedish fish. I love the sour taste sour patch kids give since it's not TOO sour but just right there on the edge of tolerable and not and then the sweet comes in and makes it all better.The swedish fish candy on the other hand has a tart taste but sweet and fruity. I just realized I should try them together writing this review and see what that tastes like. Anyways it's a decent sized package per pack and this box included 20 of them. All the candies I've tried in it with the kids have been fresh and nothing expired or anything. My kids had a blast when they saw the box get opened and all the candy in there. For the price I would say it's pretty decent for what you are getting. I assume you could get bulk bags or something but this makes it easy to send with your kid or something for a class treat or hand out for birthday part favors.Read more,2 people found this helpful

SOUR PATCH KIDS and SWEDISH FISH Mini Soft & Chewy...,Sadie,4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2025","It should be 5 stars. It's 10 packs of sour patch kids and swedish fish each. These are the plastic bags (not movie box sized), big enough to share. Problem is they're about to expire. All mine say July or August of 2025. Yes, they're the name brand, taste like it, and didn't melt during shipping. But if I have to risk expiration dates, I'll keep going to the grocery store where I can check the dates myself.Read more",One person found this helpful

SOUR PATCH KIDS and SWEDISH FISH Mini Soft & Chewy...,sQuirrel,2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2025","The candies seem to be close to their expiration date. It feels a bit disappointing to get someone else’s leftover candy that’s about to expire. The taste is still good, but the freshness is definitely not what I expected. Thank goodness we had a party with lots of kids to get rid of them at, because otherwise, they would have expired before we even got to eat them all.Read more",One person found this helpful
SOUR PATCH KIDS and SWEDISH FISH Mini Soft & Chewy...,L. F.,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2025","Its Sour Patch and Swedish fish, I don't know if anyone needs me to comment on the candy itself... For what its worth, the expiration dates I received were 3 months and 6 months out from when I got the candy.As a set, these are all 2oz servings which weirdly is not mentioned in the listing. I find this to be a really good snack size for an adult. I don't believe I've seen these sold in stores nearby in this size so I'm happy for that.That said, if you are someone who has self control, you can get a much better unit price at your local grocery store. These are about 62 cents per oz, but an 8oz bag by me costs 35 cents per oz. A 3.5oz box is 43 cents per oz. But... that requires self control to not eat the whole thing in one sittingHopefully by the time you're reading this, the price of the set is down below $20 and then it starts being a compelling price point. So 5 stars for the candy and serving size itself which is what I'm supposed to be reviewing, 1 star for the price.Read more",
